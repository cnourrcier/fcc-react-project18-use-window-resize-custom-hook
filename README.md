# useWindowResize Custom Hook

Part 18 of the freeCodeCamp 25 React Projects for interview.

This project implements a custom React hook, useWindowResize, designed to track and respond to window resize events. The hook leverages React's useLayoutEffect and useState to dynamically update the dimensions of the window whenever it is resized.
